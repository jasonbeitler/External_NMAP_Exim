# nmap_scans

Just a repo with some automated NMAP Scans. They are all written in Ruby and will work with 2.x. 

**Make sure you view the readme in each folder for gems needed / email type**

Okay I lied.. there are some Masscan scripts as well. **WARNING** If you dont know how to use masscan or have not used it before, please for the love of Network Engineers look at the warnings of masscan. 

I am not responsible for you killing your network because you did not RTFM

**DISCLAIMER**
These scripts are for use with your IPs or IPs you have premission to scan. I will not take responsibility if you use these scripts to scan IPs you do not have premission to scan or otherwise use them in a malicious way.
